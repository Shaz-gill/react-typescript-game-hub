# 🎮 React-Typescript-Game-Hub 🚀

A sleek and interactive game discovery web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **React Query**. Explore, search, and filter your favorite games with a modern, responsive UI designed for an immersive experience.

This project uses the **RAWG.io API** to fetch and display detailed game information, providing users with a comprehensive gaming database.

⚠️ **Note:** This is a **hobby project** and is only the frontend part of the application. It uses my RAWG API key, which can be seen by anyone using developer tools. Be mindful of API usage limits! It is **not recommended** to expose API keys in frontend code, as they can be easily accessed by anyone. Instead, API keys should be stored securely in environment variables on a backend server to prevent unauthorized usage.
